# Emotion-Detection-of-your-Favorite-Toons

Emotion Recognition is a field that computer systems have become eminent at identifying; whether or not it’s via pictures, video or audio. Emotion Recognition has proven promising improvements when combined with classifiers and Deep Neural Networks. This includes detecting facial expressions in pictures and videos. While the majority of studies makes use of human faces while trying to apprehend fundamental emotions, there has been little research on whether similar deep learning strategies may be implemented to faces in cartoons. The motive of this project is to know how precise a machine can efficiently perceive emotion from a given set of pictures obtained from animated videos using convolution Image classification Models like Resnet, Inceptionv3, MobileNet and VGG and an object detection Model. This project is about reflecting on their success and discovering if these deep learning strategies may be implemented to research precise statistics. This selection is primarily based on the truth that cartoons are known to express numerous emotions, especially in the characters, and the option being ‘animated cartoons’ is that we can extract emotions from those characters in movies.
